## Powerful tool for building full-stack and completely reactive user interfaces using PHP

Imagine Vue js or Angular but in PHP world with the similar user-friendly html templates and components, the application that acts like frontend framework and backend template engine at the same time and renders identical contents on both sides. And you don't even need Node js. Isn't it awesome?

### Stage: PoC

Not production ready yet, as it's in development and still needs a lot of work

#### *Requirements: php 7.4 or 8.0+*

Supported versions will be expanded  in the future
